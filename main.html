    <p class="edits">A lot of people feel stuck or imprisoned or confined by their<br>
        current circumstances. Whatever your circumstances right<br>
        now, that is only your current reality, and current reality will<br>
        begin to change as a result of beginning
    <br>
        Your current reality or your current life is a result of the thoughts<br>
        you have been thinking. All of that will totally change as you begin<br>
        to change your thoughts and your feelings.<br><br>
    <b>"That a man can change himself... and master his<br>

    <p class="edits">When you want to change your circumstances,you must<br>
        first change your thinking. Every time you look inside<br>
        your mail expecting to see a bill, guess what — it'll be<br>
        there. Each day you go out dreading the bill! You're never<br>
        expecting anything great. You're thinking debt, you're<br>
        expecting debt. So debt must show up so you won't think<br>
        you're crazy. And every day you confirm your thought: Is<br>
        debt going to be there? Yes, debt's there. Is debt going to<br>
        be there? Yes, debt's there. Is debt going to be there? Yes,<br>
        debt's there. Wiry? Because you expected debt to be there.<br>
        So it showed up, because the law of attraction is always<br>
        being obedient to your thoughts. Do yourself a favor—<br>
        expect a check!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Expectation is a powerful attractive force, because it draws things<br>
        to you. As Bob Proctor says, "Desire connects you with the thing<br>
        desired and expectation draws it into your life." Expect the things<br>
        you want and don't expect the things you don't want. What do<br>
        you expect now?</p><br><br>

    <p class="edits">What can you do right now to begin to turn your life<br>
        around? The very first thing is to start making a list of<br>
        things to be grateful for. This shifts your energy and starts to<br>
        shift your thinking. Whereas before this exercise you might<br>
        be focusing on what you don't have, your complaints, and<br>
        your problems, you go in a different direction when you do<br>
        this exercise. You start to be grateful for all the things that<br>
        you feel good about.</p><br>

        brings your whole mind into closer harmony<br>
        with the creative energies of the Universe,<br>
        consider it well, and you will see that it is true."<br><br>

    <p class="edits" align="center">Gratitude has been such a powerful exercise for me.<br>
        Every morning I get up and say "Thank you." Every morning,<br>
        when my feet hit the floor, "Thank you." And then I start<br>
        running through what I'm grateful for, as I'm brushing<br>
        my teeth and doing the things I do in the morning. And I'm<br>
        not just thinking about them and doing some rote routine.<br>
        I'm putting it out there and I'm feeling the feelings of<br>
        gratitude.</p>
    <p class="edits" align="center">
        As soon as you start to feel different about what you already<br>
        have, you will start to attract more of the good things. More<br>
        of the things you can he grateful for. You could look around<br>
        and say, "Well, I don't have the car I want. I don't have the<br>
        house I want. I don't have the spouse I want. I don't have the<br>
        health I want" Whoah! Back up, back up! Those are all the<br>
        things you don't want. Focus on what you already have that<br>
        you're grateful for. And it might be that you have the eyes<br>
        to read this. It might be the clothes that you have. Yes, you<br>
        might prefer something else and you might get something<br>
        else pretty soon, if you start feeling grateful for what you<br>
        have.
